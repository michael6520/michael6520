### Hey, I'm Michael

I'm a student and aspring software developer who enjoys solving problems, learning new technologies, and building projects. I've worked with C, C++, C#, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Right now I'm working on web API development through school projects, as well as a few personal projects like building an Hack architecture ALU in Minecraft and making a program to solve minesweeper.
