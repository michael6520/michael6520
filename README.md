### Hey, I'm Michael

I'm a student and aspring software developer who enjoys solving problems, learning new technologies, and building projects. I've worked with C, C++, C#, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Right now I'm working on web API development through school projects, as well as a few personal projects like building an Hack architecture computer in Minecraft and making a program to solve minesweeper.

## Projects and Work
**Minecraft ALU:** One part of the computer I'm working on building. It's a fully functional 8-bit hack architecture ALU I built using a system Minecraft has called 'redstone,' which simulates logical circuits.
**Sudoku Solver:** My first software project — a desktop application that solves Sudoku puzzles. Users input the known numbers, and the solver completes the grid by first using logical deductions and then doing recursive backtracking if logic wasn't enough.
